# Probabilistic inversion of CRN depth profile data

This Python 2.7 package contains the (1) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and (2) lattice-based Monte Carlo codes 
used for probabilistic inversion of cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) depth profile data in [Laloy et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-5-331-2017).

More information can be found in the run_mcmc.py and run_mc.py scripts of the 'MCMC_Inversion' and 'LatticeBasedMC_Inversion' folders, respectively.

## Performing the inversion

To perform the inversion, and postprocess its results (including figure creation), one can conveniently run the different sections (e.g., using Spyder) 
in run_mcmc.py for the MCMC inversion and run_mc.py for the lattice-based MC inversion.
